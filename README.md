# Simple web scraper with a web site UI for searching products from amazon

## How to run

To run, simply clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/luiznasc/assessment.git
```

Then go into the project folder and run npm install:

```
$ npm i
```

After that, just run the project backend and frontend servers(either on different terminals or detached) with node:

```
$ node ./api/app.js
...

$ node ./web/web.js
...
```

Go into your local host, port 8000 and the search will be available. Type in the search box and click the "search" button. Your results will show below the search box.
Alternatively, you could just open ```project-directory/product-scraper/web/webpage.html``` on your browser.
